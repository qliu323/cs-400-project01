The last human being on earth sat in a room reading a book. At that moment, the door of the room burst open.
It weas a talking Tiger who said "That book is Grrreat".
The human said that the Tiger could not have their book, because it was the last book on earth. The tiger ate him, because it was a Tiger. That is the story of how humans went extinct.
It is also the story of how Tigers became the apex predator of the planet, as they were the only predator of the planet.
The End
